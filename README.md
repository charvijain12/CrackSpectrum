# Crack-Detection-Classification-of-Concrete-Structures
Deep Object Damage Analysis of Concrete Structures using CNN model.
#
The project aims to develop a crack detection and classification system for concrete structures using image processing and machine learning techniques. The system involves pre-processing of images, feature extraction using edge detection and segmentation techniques, and classification using a convolutional neural network (CNN). The dataset used for training and testing the system includes images of concrete structures with and without cracks. The accuracy of the system is evaluated using performance metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score. The results indicate that the proposed system is effective in detecting and classifying cracks in concrete structures with high accuracy.
