# CrackSpectrum: Crack Detection & Classification of Concrete Structures 🏗️🔍

The CrackSpectrum project aims to develop a system that can detect and classify cracks in concrete structures using image processing and machine learning techniques. This system involves pre-processing of images, feature extraction using edge detection and segmentation techniques, and classification using a convolutional neural network (CNN). 📸⚙️🤖

## Dataset 📊

The dataset used for training and testing the system includes images of concrete structures with and without cracks. The dataset is available on Kaggle at this link: [Crack Detection Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/code/dhruv1234/crack-detection-opencv/input). 📁

## Results 📈

The accuracy of the system is evaluated using performance metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score. The results indicate that the proposed system is effective in detecting and classifying cracks in concrete structures with high accuracy. 🎯✔️

## Repository Contents 📂

The repository includes the following files:

1. `Crack Detection & Classification of Concrete Structures.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the code for the crack detection and classification system.

2. `Crack Detection & Classification of Concrete Structures.py`: Python script version of the Jupyter notebook for easier integration into a production environment.

3. `README.md`: Readme file with an overview of the project and instructions for running the code.
